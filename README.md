Input mathematical equations into an add-on in Blender and have them be animated automatically.
These code files are meant to be run under the PyCharm plugin called fake-bpy-module, https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module, which allows one to live edit a Blender add-on.
I suggest using chat gpt to understand any code.
