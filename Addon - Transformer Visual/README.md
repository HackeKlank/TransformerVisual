Input mathematical equations into an add-on in Blender and have them be animated automatically.
These code files are meant to be run under the PyCharm plugin called fake-bpy-module, https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module, which allows one to live edit a Blender add-on.
I suggest using chat gpt to understand any code.

Previous ideas:
We postulate that time is its own one directional dimension with respect to all other spacial dimensions.
Automatically, the animate function will treat time as its own dimension and modify all projections of higher
dimensional objects onto Euclidean 3-space so that the parameterization of an n-dimensional grid onto a manifold becomes
itself a function of time.
Time will then be incremented and keyframes for the Euclidean shape will be put in place so that an animation can be
created and rendered.
